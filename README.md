# PRO2 Final Practise - Text Library

Hello everyone! 
In this repository you can find all the code from the Text Library practise from **PRO2** Q2 spring 2015/2016 subject from FIB - UPC. With this program you are going to be able to manage your own "text repository", for the purposes that you prefer. First of all, however, we have to give you and advise: This program don't have any database, so it's not a program that you can use in the real life.

## How to use it

In the repository you are not going to find the binary file which contains the compiled program. Anyway, if you are a Mac or Linux user, you can follow the next steps:

1. Clone the repository on your computer
2. Open the terminal and go to the folder of the repository
3. We provide you a Makefile, so you can make your own binary file by typing `Make` as a command
4. Enjoy!
